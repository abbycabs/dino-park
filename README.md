# dino-park
a playground project forlearning github at #mozsprint 2018

Hello! Welcome to the Dino Park Project, a **fake** open project to help new Mozsprint participants learn how to contribute using collaboration tools. 

This project aims to design and build the world's first open dinosaur park. There are not enough (or any) dinosaur parks in the world today featuring live dinosuars, and we hope to change that, with your help!

We are looking for feedback on the early stages of park planning. Anyone who likes dinosaurs, parks, or picnics can help-- check out our Issues tabs for tasks to work on. 

Want to chat with us during Mozilla's Global Sprint? Head over to the Global Sprint Gitter Chat-- you can ping @acabunoc or @zee-moz. Or leave a comment on any issue and we'll reply as soon as we can.

This project aheres to Mozilla's Participation Guidelines, please check them out!
